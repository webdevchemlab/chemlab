Okay, let's outline a detailed development plan for a complete e-commerce web app for ChemLab Synthesis using Next.js and Medusa.js. This plan will cover the key phases, features, and technical considerations.

I. Project Goals & Scope Refinement:

Confirm Core Functionality: We aim for a full-fledged e-commerce experience, but with potential nuances due to the nature of chemical sales (e.g., potentially more emphasis on "Request a Quote" than direct checkout, depending on regulations and your pricing strategy).

Target Audience Focus: Remember your primary users are researchers, academics, and lab professionals. The design and functionality should cater to their needs.

Define Initial Scope (MVP): For the initial launch, prioritize essential features. You can add more advanced features in later iterations.

II. Technology Stack:

Frontend: Next.js (React framework for server-side rendering, routing, and performance).

Backend/Headless CMS: Medusa.js (Node.js based e-commerce platform, highly customizable, API-first).

Database: PostgreSQL (default for Medusa.js, robust and scalable).

Payment Gateway: (To be selected – consider options like Stripe, PayPal, or specialized solutions for B2B transactions).

Search: (Consider options like Algolia, Elasticsearch for better product discovery).

Hosting: (For Next.js – Vercel, Netlify; For Medusa.js – Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, or self-hosted).

State Management (Frontend): React Context API or a library like Zustand/Recoil if needed for complex state.

Styling: CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or Styled Components.

Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (for end-to-end).
